# Shmup
A Shmup template project.

This was originally made as a teaching aid to introduce the topics of C# and game design to first time Unity users in 2020. 
I've updated the code and fixed a few small issues with it. Also I've added in an object pooler for most objects. 
There's still more optimisation that could be done and a lot more features that can be included.
